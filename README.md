# Metacclaimed Playlist

This is the first project which offered great value to me in my every day life. Iâ€™ve spent many hours bouncing between Metacritic and Spotify looking for new music until I decided to fully automate it.

I built an automation script to scrape album review data from Metacritic and build playlists using the Spotify API from the 2 most popular tracks from each album which scored over some user-defined threshold.

Since Metacritic did not have a publicly available API, I had to scrape HTML data using BeautifulSoup. The script was hosted on PythonAnywhere and ran daily to update the Spotify playlists for This worked perfectly for over a year, but now Metacritic has changed its website format. I plan to revisit this project in the near future to get it running again.
